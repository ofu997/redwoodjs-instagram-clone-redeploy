    PRISMA DOCS: use multiple select statements to return relation fields
    Use include  to include all fields from related records, such as a user's posts or profile, in the query response.
    Use a nested select  to include specific fields from a related record. You can also nest select inside an include.
    Nested writes: the following nested write creates a User and two related Post records:
    Add new related records to an existing record
    You can nest create or createMany inside an update to add new related records to an existing record. The following query adds two posts to a user with an id of 9:

display comments
SignUpForm should create user
SignInForm should authenticate

associate comments with user
